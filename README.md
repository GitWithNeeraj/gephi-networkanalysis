# gephi-networkanalysis
Analysing the segregation levels of a city using network metrics
The project's goal is to use network
measurements to investigate how people's movement
inside a city can divide it into "bubbles" or
“communities”. Data from connections between
mobile phones and the nearest cell towers in Santiago,
Chile are included in the collection in an anonymized
form. Four activities are required for completion of the
project: creating networks, using Gephi to analyse
communities, determining node centrality, and
calculating the likelihood of residents working in one
community while also residing in another. The
initiative aims to determine whether the city is
segregated as well as whether it has multiple
centralised poles or one central pole.
